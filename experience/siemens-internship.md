### 💡 What I Learned & Built

- 🔒 **Diving into Cybersecurity**  
   Got curious about threats and defense: scanned for system vulnerabilities, ran real security tests with Lynis, locked down Linux systems step by step and made SSH a true security gate.

- 🌐 **Networking From Basics to Big Picture**  
   I connected virtual machines, experimented with real network protocols and saw how a company keeps its systems strong and connected.

- 🖥️ **Hands on Infrastructure Setup**  
   Built virtual machines with Debian, explored LVM and RAID, and learned how to restore systems with VirtualBox snapshots, from zero to working.

- 🔁 **Automation That Actually Saves Time**  
   Created Jenkins pipelines from scratch, managed master and agent builds, connected Git for team coding and spun up Docker containers until deploying was easy.

- 🐧 **Linux Like a Pro**  
   Learned my way around APT and DPKG, tuned essential commands, managed users and explored how Linux actually boots up—no more mysteries.

- 📡 **IoT: Making Devices Talk**  
   Turned Raspberry Pis into smart sensors, connected them to networks, enabled secure remote access and even tested everything in virtual sandbox environments.

- 🛠️ **Unlocking Advanced IT**  
   Explored system foundations like BIOS/UEFI, the boot process, managed services with systemd and helped roll out real company machines and software.

- ⚠️ **Risk? Saw It, Fixed It**  
   Learned to spot potential security issues, read and understand reports and document fixes so our systems stay safe, not just today, but for the future.
