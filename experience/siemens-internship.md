From the very first day, the team at Siemens made me feel at home. Individuals like Hasan Güzelmansur (https://www.linkedin.com/in/hasan-güzelmansur/), Emir Demircan (https://www.linkedin.com/in/emir-demircan-119924245/), Gamze Nur Kaba (https://www.linkedin.com/in/gnkaba/) and Alp Gökdelen (https://www.linkedin.com/in/gokdelen/) weren't just colleagues; they were mentors who actively shared their knowledge, encouraged every question and were always there for me. This incredibly supportive environment made me look forward to coming in each morning. I got a chance to see a bit of what other teams and departments at Siemens do.
