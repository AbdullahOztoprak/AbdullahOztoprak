## üöÄ Siemens: My Department's World
### Foundational Technologies - Automation and Connectivity
Beyond my daily tasks, I quickly began to understand the big picture of my department's work. A dedicated tour was incredibly helpful, allowing me to get up close with some of the actual devices Siemens develops, seeing innovation in action. 

I also got a brief overview of projects like AC NET1 & TI Projects and was introduced to specific Siemens products such as Scalance Devices, TEST Rack Devices, Development Rack Devices and Simatic Box PCs. 
I learned that Scalance devices are Siemens's robust network components, designed for use in industrial applications.
I gained insight into DNM, which is essential for monitoring and configuring these industrial network systems. 
In summary I learned the basics about what these devices and technologies do and how they fit into Siemens' ecosystem was a huge step for understanding the company's technological scope.

Here are some of the key projects and responsibilities from my internship, focusing on what I built and the valuable lessons I took away from each experience.

*   **Learning Software Automation:**
    I designed and implemented simple Jenkins pipelines from scratch. This significantly sped up our software deployments and reduced manual effort. Through this, I gained understanding of how to create efficient and automated development workflows and general knowledge about CI/CD Pipelines.

*   **Understanding System Security Importance:**
    Cybersecurity: Got my first real taste of Cybersecurity. Ran vulnerability scans and helped secure Linux systems, especially SSH. This experience truly highlighted the importance of a comprehensive security approach, like the one Siemens employs [https://sfera.siemens.com/#/current/policies]. It was good to see how crucial security really is.

*   **Setting up Virtual Environments:**
    I set up and managed virtual environments using VirtualBox and Debian VMs. I also began to understand the concepts behind storage solutions like LVM and RAID and configured simple network setups. This project helped me grasp the fundamentals of building robust and resilient system infrastructures.

*   **Developing an LLM Powered Q&A System:**
    I developed a Question-Answering system based on Large Language Models (LLMs), utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and a Gradio web interface. This system allowed for intelligent data retrieval from our internship resources. This project was a deep dive into advanced AI techniques and how to apply them practically into the real world.

*   **Bringing IoT Prototypes to Life:**
    I successfully set up and deployed IoT sensor prototypes on Raspberry Pi. This taught me the practical aspects of connected devices and their real world applications.

*   **Gaining Experience in IT workflow:**
    I contributed to daily IT operations by performing corporate PC setups, deploying essential software and configuring systems. This experience gave me a solid understanding of efficient IT workflow management and how to support a smooth operational environment.
