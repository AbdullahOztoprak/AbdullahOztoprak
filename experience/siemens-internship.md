### 💡 What I Learned & Built

- 🖥️ **Real World Systems**  
   Set up Debian virtual machines, practiced real networking, LVM, RAID, and used VirtualBox snapshots—gaining confidence in infrastructure from scratch.

- 🔁 **Automation & DevOps**  
   Built CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins (master–agent style!), integrated Git, ran builds, and used Docker for painless test environments, so delivery was always fast and smooth.

- 🛡️ **Hands On Security**  
   Ran real security audits with Lynis, hardened systems, improved SSH defense, and boosted security scores for peace of mind.

- 🐧 **Linux Mastery**  
   Navigated the essentials: APT, DPKG, critical commands, user management, and even the mysteries of the Linux boot process.

- 📡 **IoT in Action**  
   Flashed and configured Raspberry Pis, set up remote shell access, and even ran Pi OS in VirtualBox to develop and test safely.

- 🛠️ **Advanced Infrastructure**  
   Explored BIOS vs UEFI, the boot journey, systemd, and rolled out company software and machines with real hands on practice.

- ⚠️ **Risk Awareness**  
   Learned to spot digital risks, interpret security reports, and create actionable documentation to keep systems safe and smart.
