### 💡 What I Learned & Built

- **Real-World Systems:** I quickly got hands-on with virtual machine setup (Debian), learned about network basics, LVM, RAID, and performed snapshot management with VirtualBox.  
- **Automation & DevOps:** Designed Jenkins pipelines, set up a master-agent structure, launched builds and managed agents, integrated Git for source control, and even orchestrated Docker-powered test environments.  
- **Security:** Discovered practical security and hardening using tools like Lynis; performed security audits, learned the importance of SSH hardening, and improved system scores with hardening best practices.  
- **Linux Mastery:** Mastered essential Linux commands, package management (APT, DPKG), and focused on system processes—from boot sequence to managing user permissions.  
- **IoT in Action:** Set up Raspberry Pi operating systems, did image flashing, initial network and SSH configuration, remote access, and even virtualized Pi OS for secure, flexible development and testing.  
- **Advanced Infrastructure:** Explored BIOS/UEFI, POST, bootloaders, service management (systemd), and hands-on with actual company hardware and software rollout processes.
- **Risk Awareness:** Learned how to analyze digital risks and apply documentation-based solutions in line with corporate standards.
