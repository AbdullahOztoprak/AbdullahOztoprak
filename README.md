## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m Abdullah, a Computer Engineering student at the Turkish-German University. I’m naturally curious and always eager to explore new areas and expand my skills.

Right now, my main focus is on AI technologies, network security and software engineering. I have a strong interest in DevOps, cybersecurity and building automated systems that run reliably and make life easier.

I believe the best way to learn is by creating and experimenting and this portfolio is a reflection of the projects and ideas I’ve brought to life.
