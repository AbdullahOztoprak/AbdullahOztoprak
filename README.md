## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm Abdullah, a curious and driven Computer Engineering student who enjoys solving real-world problems with code.  
I'm especially interested in **DevOps**, **Cybersecurity**, **AI technologies** and building **automated systems** that just work.

I believe that learning by doing is the most powerful approach — and this portfolio is a reflection of that.

## 📚 Bootcamp Projects

### Image Processing Bootcamp – Aygaz  
Jupyter Notebook · Python · OpenCV · CNN · Keras

- Built a CNN model to classify 10 animal classes using a Kaggle dataset  
- Applied techniques like data augmentation, brightness manipulation and color constancy  
- Used pre-trained VGG16 for transfer learning with custom dense layers  
- Tested model performance on original, manipulated and corrected test sets  
- Faced and documented model input shape issue during final architecture upgrade

### House Price Prediction – Real Estate Data Analysis  
Pandas · Data Cleaning · EDA · Feature Engineering

- Analyzed a real estate dataset from Kaggle with 168,000+ entries  
- Cleaned missing values using median, mode and forward-fill techniques  
- Performed EDA using visual tools (box plots, histograms, heatmaps)  
- Explored correlations between features like area, price and location  
- Prepared the dataset for future machine learning models
