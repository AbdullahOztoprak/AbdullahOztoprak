## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm Abdullah, a curious and driven Computer Engineering student who enjoys solving real-world problems with code.  
I'm especially interested in **DevOps**, **Cybersecurity**, and building **automated systems** that just work.

I believe that **learning by doing** is the most powerful approach — and this portfolio is a reflection of that.  
When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring Linux internals or automating things with Python 🐍.
